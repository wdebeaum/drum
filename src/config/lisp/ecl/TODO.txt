1 Nov 2006:

- Don't yet know how to dump and image or run one with ecl

  - The function to build the image is c:build-program

    http://ecls.sourceforge.net/ecldev/Building-standalone-executables.html#Building-standalone-executables

  - The resulting executable probably won't need a wrapper, but we'll
    see (might need the TRIPS_BASE stuff or something)
