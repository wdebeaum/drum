NOTE: as far as I know, CLISP does *not* work with TRIPS.
I created this directory just so I could get the system
configured and working on windows (cygwin has clisp).
I only fiddled with things until the configure script
got working -- I have no idea if the rest of the things
here actually work or are the correct settings.

Oh, on another note -- to configure with clisp,
right now you have to explicitly put
--with-lisp-flavor=clisp --with-fasl=fas
on the command line.  I haven't changed the configure
scripts to detect clisp *and* there is a problem
on the automatic fasl extention detection.  It assumes
that only 1 extra file is generated by compile-file (e.g.,
bob.fasl gets generated from bob.lisp), but actually,
in clisp 2 files are generated: bob.fas and bob.lib.
This throws the configure script off.
