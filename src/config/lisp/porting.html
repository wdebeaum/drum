<h1>Porting TRIPS to a new Lisp</h1>

Very brief description of what to do in order to port the TRIPS Lisp
configuration to a new platform and/or Lisp implementation.

<ol>
<li>Create new sub-directory for your configuration. For example, if
  you're porting to <q><code>foocl</code></q>, you might make the
  sub-directory <code>foocl</code>. Brilliant!
</li>
<li>Create <code>extensions.lisp</code> in your platform's
  sub-directory.  The code loaded here implements the standard set of
  non-CL functions exported from the TRIPS package. It is my intention
  to (eventually) be able to check that the extensions have all been
  implemented. The best approach here is to copy an existing version
  of <code>extensions.lisp</code> and adjust the magic for your new
  platform.
</li>
<li>Create <code>defs.mk</code> in your platform's
  sub-directory. These GNU <code>make</code> definitions are used in
  compiling and dumping lisp components. Here be dragons, but only
  baby ones. Copy an existing one and adjust as needed.
</li>
<li>Edit <code>trips.lisp</code>:
 <ol>
 <li>Filesystem-specific pathname code (i.e., slashes, backslashes, or
 something else). The code loaded here controls how pathnames
 expressed using the pseudo-logical-filename syntax get converted into
 real pathnames. This will be either:
  <ol>
  <li><code>unix</code> (all modern unix-based platforms, including
      OSX);</li>
  <li><code>macos</code> (old Mac OS; no longer used); or</li>
  <li><code>windows</code> (once I put back the support).
  </ol>
 You need to make sure that the conditional works properly for your
 new platform. This should be straightforward.
 </li>
 <li>Platform-specific code (i.e., extensions to Common Lisp): Add a
 case to pickup your platform-specific code.
 </li>
 </ol>
</li>
<li>Adjust <code>configure.ac</code>: You will at least need to add
  the new platform to the for loop that check
  for <code>LISP_FLAVOR</code>, and you may have to do further munging
  depending on what value is returned (like
  for <code>cmucl</code>).
</li>
<li>You then need to run <code>autoconf</code> to build the
  new <code>configure</code> from <code>configure.ac</code>. Note that
  we check in both <code>configure.ac</code>
  and <code>configure</code> itself so that mere mortals don't
  need <code>autoconf</code>.
</li>
<li>You should now be able to test the result by
  running <code>configure</code>. If the new Lisp platform is not run
  by invoking simply <code>lisp</code>, you should pass in the right
  executable as in:
  <pre>
  ./configure --with-lisp=foocl
  </pre>
</li>
<li>You may need to adjust defsystem settings. In
  particular, <code>defsystem/defsystem.lisp</code> loads the
  distributed defsystem and then performs various customizations (such
  as tweaking filename suffixes and adjusting output). You may need a
  case there, although hopefully not in
  the <code>defsystem-<i>version</i>/defsystem.lisp</code> itself.
</li>
</ol>
