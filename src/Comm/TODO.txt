- The method for using the current process to find a :sender in the
  internal transport is broken if a client itself uses multiple
  processes. Need to rethink this. Meanwhile they have to specify
  :sender or get *unknown* stuck in there.

- The various "transports" really conflate *transport* with
  *protocol*. That is, stdio is a transport (as is internal and
  socket), but kqml is a protocol (as would be, eg., fipa-acl). This
  could be cleaned up.
