  ;; Turke et al. “MEK inhibition leads to PI3K/AKT activation by relieving a negative feedback on ERBB receptors“ (PMC3515079)
  (turke-1
    "We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory threonine phosphorylation on the JM domains of EGFR and HER2, thereby increasing ERBB3 phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we transiently transfected CHO-KI cells, which do not express ERBB receptors endogenously, with wild-type ERBB3 with either wild-type EGFR or EGFR T669A. In cells transfected with wild-type EGFR, MEK inhibition led to feedback activation of phospho-ERBB3 and phosho-EGFR, recapitulating the results we had observed in our panel of cancer cell lines (Figure 6A). In contrast, the EGFR T669A mutant increased both basal EGFR and ERBB3 tyrosine phosphorylation that was not augmented by MEK inhibition. As a control, we treated CHO-KI cells expressing EGFR T669A with HRG ligand to induce maximal ERBB3 phosphorylation (Figure 6A), indicating that the lack of induction of phospho-ERBB3 in EGFR T669A expressing cells following MEK inhibition was not simply due to the saturation of the system with phospho-ERBB3. We observed analogous results in CHO-KI cells expressing wild-type ERBB3 in combination with wild-type or T677A mutant HER2 (Figure 6B). Together these results support the hypothesis that inhibition of ERK-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved JM domain threonine residue leads to feedback activation of EGFR, HER2, and ERBB3 (Figure 7).")

    "To determine if this feedback model explains the activation of PI3K signaling in EGFR-mutant cancers, we used shRNA to knockdown endogenous EGFR (which carries an exon 19 deletion) in the HCC827 NSCLC cell line and replaced with either EGFR (exon 19del) wild-type at T669, or EGFR (exon 19del) carrying a T669A mutation. Of note, this is the same EGFR-mutant cell line in which we observed that EGFR T669 is phosphorylated in MEK-dependent manner (Figure 5, Supplemental Figure 8A). When endogenous EGFR was replaced with EGFR (exon19del) wild-type at T669, MEK inhibition led to significant feedback activation of ERBB3/PI3K/AKT signaling (Figure 6C). However, replacement with the EGFR (exon19 del) T669A mutant led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both EGFR and ERBB3, and activation of PI3K/AKT signaling, mimicking the effect of MEK inhibition (Figure 6C). As expected, addition of AZD6244 failed to further augment ERBB3 and AKT phosphorylation in cells expressing the 669A mutant. These results demonstrate that EGFR T669 phosphorylation is necessary for MEK/ERK to suppress EGFR-mediated activation of ERBB3. This supports the hypothesis that a dominant ERK feedback on ERBB3/PI3K/AKT is mediated though phosphorylation of T669 on EGFR (or T677 HER2).")
