- Could support two different views of the connections:
  - One is by name, which is how we do it now, but wouldn't show if
    someone was forging messages
  - The other is by connection, which would show this
    - and if there's only one name, then could use it also in the
      display

- to support adjusting the menu in the TrafficViewer, really should
  implement listeners on the registry...

- this business of temporary items on the display prior to register
  is insane
  - why not just create the item with the gensym name when the client
    connects. Then when they register, that's just another name, only
    make it the primary name. Ditto for unregister, adjusting the
    primary if needed.
    -> DONE!
