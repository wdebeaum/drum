- These classes were developed to avoid having to use an Applet (which
  extends Panel, and hence needs a window system). But one might want
  to use an applet and implement TripsModule. I need to see how this
  works and at least document what one should do if one wants this
  behavior (I think your applet needs at the very least to take its
  parameters and hand them into the contstructor for the TripsModule).
