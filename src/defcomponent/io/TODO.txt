- The method for using the current process to find a :sender in the

  internal transport is broken if a client itself uses multiple

  processes. Need to rethink this. Meanwhile they have to specify

  :sender or get *unknown* stuck in there.



- The various "transports" really conflate *transport* with

  *protocol*. That is, stdio is a transport (as is internal and

  socket), but kqml is a protocol (as would be, eg., fipa-acl). This

  could be cleaned up.
