# Drum Bob EKB Tests.
#
# This file contains assertions which are sent to the Drum and Bob
# systems in order to generate EKB which is then compared.  Non-blank
# lines which do not start with a '#' character are considered assertions.
#

# Active examples
Active p53 activates Mdm2.

# Aggregate examples
Ras and raf bind erk.

# By Means Of examples
Ras binds raf by means of mrk.

# CC examples
RAS induces cell proliferation.
SMAD4 depends on CD25.

# Cell examples
RAS is activated in pancreatic cells.

# Complex examples
MAP-2-K-1/MAPK-1 is depleted.
Ras/Raf binds to Erk.
The RAS AKT complex is depleted.

# Conjoined Examples
GTP binds and activates RAS.
GTP binds RAF and RAS activates MRK.
GTP binds or activates RAS.

# EPI Examples
The paper shows that mek activates erk.
The paper determined that mek activates erk.
I think mek activates erk.

# EPI and CC Example
#Activated RAS controls RAF which determines RAS-induced cellular responses such as cell proliferation.

# Event with DRUM info Example
LCK phosphorylates CD3E.

# INEVENT example
Activated Ras controls diverse signaling pathways.

# Location Examples
RAS is translocated to the nucleus.
RAS moves from the nucleus to the cytosol.

# MODALITY Examples
Ras may bind Raf.

# Modifier Examples
DUSP-6 dephosphorylates mark-1 on tyrosine.

# Mutation Examples
Ras S123Y is phosphorylated at T124.

# Negation Examples
Ras is not phosphorylated.

# Sequence Examples
Sos-1/Grb2/E3b1 is activated.

# Site Examples
RAS is phosphorylated at S123.

# Transcription Examples
SMAD4-SMAD2 complex increases transcription of CD25.
