<h2><a name="Expert">Info for CVS Experts</a></h2>
<p>
This information provided without explanation for CVS experts who just
want to get on with it.  The TRIPS repository is now hosted on a separate
machine: <tt>trips.cs.rochester.edu</tt>  Anyone who wants access to the
repository will need to get an account for the machine, (even people
who already have a URCS account).  Talk to Dave Costello to get it.
<ul>
  <li>Supported access methods: only <tt>ssh</tt></li>
  <li>Repository location:
<blockquote>
<tt>:ext:username@trips.cs.rochester.edu:/p/cvs/trips</tt>
</blockquote>
  </li>
</ul>
If this doesn't make sense to you, please read on!

<h2><a name="Overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p>
The following is a <em>very brief</em> overview of CVS. For much more
detail, please see the CVS manual (a.k.a. <q>Cederqvist</q>) at
<a
href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140209043007/http://ximbiot.com:80/cvs/manual/cvs-1.12.13/cvs.html">Web
Archive</a>.
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>CVS relies on a <em>repository</em> to store all the files making
up a project.</li>
<li>You access the repository to <em>checkout</em> the
files you want to work with into a <em>working directory</em>.
This does not prevent anyone else from also checking out and working
with those files.</li>
<li>When you want to make your changes available to
others, you <em>commit</em> the changes back to the repository.</li>
<li>If someone else has committed changes that overlap with yours, CVS
indicates a <em>conflict</em> that must be resolved before the
file can be committed.</li>
<li>To pick up any changes made by others, you <em>update</em>
your working directory.</li>
<li>Every time a change is committed, CVS makes a new
<em>version</em> of the file. Versions can be given symbolic
names, known as <em>tags</em>.
<li>CVS supports multiple <em>branches</em> of development on the
same files. Changes on different branches do not affect each other,
until the branches are <em>merged</em>.
</ul>
</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a name="Repository">Repository</a></h2>
<p>
There are three ways to access a CVS repository: <b>(Note: because the repository is now
located on a different server, it can <em>only</em> be accessed through <tt>ssh</tt>)</b>
<ol>
<li>On a local filesystem;</li>
<li>Using external (remote) access, typically <tt>rsh</tt> or
<tt>ssh</tt>; or</li>
<li>Via a CVS server (known as a <q>pserver</q>).</li>
</ol>
Without going into too many details, let me just say that:
<ul>
<li>A local repository is generally fastest,
but of course you can only access the respository when you can mount
it. It also has the least control since local users can do arbitrary
things to the filesystem.</li>
<li>Remote access via <tt>rsh</tt> or more commonly <tt>ssh</tt> is
more flexible, but requires that you have a login account on the machine
hosting the repository (technically, on a machine that mounts the
repository).</li>
<li>Accessing via pserver works without this limitation, but
unfortunately pserver is riddled with security holes and is not
considered safe to expose outside the firewall. Tunnelling pserver via
ssh works, but then you might as well use external access via ssh in
the first place.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
Regardless, you only need to specify the repository when you
initially checkout your working directory. After that, information
stored in the working directory (in the <q>CVS</q> directory, to be
precise) allows CVS to find the repository.
<ul>
<li>To specify a local filesystem repository, give the pathname of the
repository as the <tt>-d</tt> argument of the <tt>cvs</tt> command, as
in:
<blockquote>
<tt>cvs -d <em>pathname</em> checkout ...</tt>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>To specify an external repository, you give something that
looks like a URL but isn't as the <tt>-d</tt> argument, as in:
<blockquote>
<tt>cvs -d :ext:<em>user</em>@<em>host</em>/<em>pathname</em> checkout ...</tt>
</blockquote>
Note the leading colon in <q><tt>:ext:</tt></q>.
</p><p>
To make CVS use <tt>ssh</tt> rather than its default <tt>rsh</tt>, you
need to set the environment variable <tt>CVS_RSH</tt> to <tt>ssh</tt>:
<ul>
<li>For csh/tcsh, in .login or .cshrc:
<blockquote>
<tt>setenv CVS_RSH ssh</tt>
</blockquote></li>
<li>For sh/bash, in .login or .profile:
<blockquote>
<tt>CVS_RSH=ssh; export CVS_RSH</tt>
</blockquote></li>
</ul>
<li>To specify a pserver repository, you use:
<blockquote>
<tt>cvs -d :pserver:<em>host</em>/<em>pathname</em> checkout ...</tt>
</blockquote>
Again, note the leading colon in <q><tt>:pserver:</tt></q>.</li>
<li>Instead of always specifying <tt>-d</tt>, you can set the
environment variable <tt>CVS_ROOT</tt> before running CVS, for example
in a login or startup script.</li>
</ul>
</p><p>
The main CVS repository for TRIPS is: <tt>/p/cvs/trips</tt>
<ul>
<li>For local access:
<blockquote>
<tt>cvs -d /p/cvs/trips checkout ...</tt>
</blockquote></li>
<li>For external access:
<blockquote>
<tt>setenv CVS_RSH ssh<br/>
cvs -d :ext:<em>user</em>@<em>host</em>/p/cvs/trips checkout ...</tt>
</blockquote>
where <tt><em>user</em></tt> is your login username and
<tt><em>host</em></tt> is any regular URCS hostname, such as
<tt>cycle1.cs.rochester.edu</tt>.</li>
<li>There is no longer any pserver access to the TRIPS repository.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
To obtain password-free access to the CVS reporitory, generate SSH keys using
<blockquote>
<tt>ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 2048<tt/>
</blockquote>
This will create a private key (in <tt>id_rsa</tt>) and a public key (in
<tt>id_rsa.pub</tt>). Send your public key to Dave Costello to add it to the
authorized keys on the CVS server. After that, run a CVS command and, when you
get asked for the password, type it in and tell your SSH agent to remember the
password. 
</p>

<hr/>
<h2><a name="Modules">Modules</a></h2>
CVS supports the notion of <q>modules</q>--a set of files and
directories that get checked out together. We use
these modules to provide convenient ways to checkout various subsets
of the TRIPS source code for specific purposes. Note that this use of
the term <q>module</q> in CVS is not the same as what we
mean by a <q>TRIPS module</q>.
</p><p>
<ul>
<li>To checkout the entire source tree into the current directory, use:
<blockquote>
 <tt>cvs -d <em>repository</em> checkout src</tt>
</blockquote>
This is not recommended since (a) any given system will only use a
small part of tree, and (b) the amount of cruft greatly exceeds the
amount of useful code.
</li>
<li>To checkout an individual directory (for example, an individual
TRIPS component or library):
<blockquote>
 <tt>cvs -d <em>repository</em> src/<em>component</em></tt>
</blockquote>
This will checkout into a directory named
<tt>src/<em>component</em></tt> below the current directory.
</li>
<li>To checkout the sources for all the components of a given
configuration of the TRIPS system:
<blockquote>
 <tt>cvs -d <em>repository</em> <em>module</em></tt>
</blockquote>
This will checkout into a directory named <tt>src</tt> in the current
directory but will only include those components that are part of
<tt><em>module</em></tt>.
<p>As of this writing, the there i a long list of defined modules.
Other CVS modules may be defined. The only way to know for sure which
modules are defined is to checkout the modules list, which is left as
an exercise.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a name="Using">Using CVS</a></h2>
<p>
Here we walk briefly through the use of the various CVS commands that
are used most frequently.
</p>
<h3>Checking out a working directory</h3>
<p>
To start working with TRIPS, checkout the source tree. You should
replace <tt><em>repository</em></tt> with one of the forms listed in
the Expert section (either a pathname to a local repository, an
external specification for a remote repository, or a pserver
specification).
<blockquote>
<tt>
% mkdir work<br/>
% cd work<br/>
% cvs -d <em>repository</em> checkout -P src<br/>
...<br/>
% cd src<br/>
% rm -rf [directories that you don't care about]<br/>
</tt>
</blockquote>
The <tt>-P</tt> option to <tt>checkout</tt> means to ignore
(<q>prune</q>) empty directories, which are otherwise left
behind by CVS when a directory is renamed.
</p>
<h3>Checking status</h3>
<p>
When you want to check status of your files with respect to the
repository:
<blockquote><tt>% cvs status</tt></blockquote>
or, less verbosely and much more readably:
<blockquote><tt>% cvs -n -q update</tt></blockquote>
That is, update, but don't actually do it (<tt>-n</tt>) and don't be
verbose about it (<tt>-q</tt>). This is so handy that you might want
to make an alias for it.
With no arguments, both of these commands will do the current directory
and, recursively, any sub-directories. Or you can specify specific
files for it to check by given them on the command-line following the
command.
</p><p>
The meanings of the various letters in the output of <tt>cvs
update</tt> is as follows:
<dl>
<dt><tt>U</tt></dt>
<dd>An updated version of the file is available and will be checked
out if you do an update.</dd>
<dt><tt>M</tt></dt>
<dd>You have modified your copy of the file but not committed the
changes.</dd>
<dt><tt>C</tt></dt>
<dd>You have modified your copy of the file, and there is a
conflict between your changes and the copy currently in the
repository (ie., someone else has checked in conflicting changes).</dd>
<dt><tt>A</tt></dt>
<dd>The file has been scheduled for addition with <tt>cvs add</tt> but
the addition has not yet been committed.</dd>
<dt><tt>R</tt></dt>
<dd>The file has been scheduled for removal with <tt>cvs remove</tt>
but the removal has not yet been committed.</dd>
<dt><tt>?</tt></dt>
<dd>The file is not under CVS control (use <tt>cvs add</tt> to add
it).</dd>
</dl>
</p>
<h3>Getting other developer's changes</h3>
<p>
To put your working directory in sync with the repository:
<blockquote><tt>% cvs update</tt></blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Any files changed by others but unchanged by you will be updated
(ie., the new version will be checked out).</li>
<li>Any files changed by
you and by others that don't conflict will be updated also.</li>
<li>Any files for which there is a conflict will be reported by CVS,
and your working copy will be marked with
<tt>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</tt> to indicate
the conflicting text. You'll
need to edit them to resolve the conflict before they are useable
(the original file will be there somewhere renamed with a leading
"." if you care to look for it).</li>
<li>If someone has added new directories to the repository, the only
way to get them is by using the <tt>-d</tt> option to <tt>update</tt>.
With one or more names, this will add those directories to your
working directory. But note that with no arguments, <tt>-d</tt>
causes CVS to add any directories from the repository to your working
directory if they're not already there. As the CVS documentation
points out, you may have not checked out or have deleted some
directories on purpose, and <tt>update -d</tt> will bring them back,
which is probably not what you want. In this case you will need to
checkout the new directories manually (with <tt>checkout</tt>, or do
<tt>update -d</tt> and then delete the ones you don't want again.</li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Throwing away your changes</h3>
<p>
If you decide that you want to discard any changes to your working
copy of some file (rather than committing them) and just want a fresh
copy of the last checked-in version:
<blockquote>
<tt>
% rm foo.lisp<br/>
% cvs update foo.lisp
</tt>
</blockquote>
CVS will warn you that <q>foo.lisp was lost</q> and get you a
new copy, which is what you wanted.
</p>
<h3>Committing your changes</h3>
<p>
Once you're ready to commit your changes to the repository and make
them available to others (when they update):
<blockquote>
<tt>% cvs commit -m 'Message for log'</tt>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>With no additional arguments, this will commit the current
directory and, recursively, any sub-directories. Alternatively, you
can name specific files and/or directories on the command-line. This
can be useful if you want to record different log messages for
different files.</li>
<li>If you don't give <tt>-m</tt>, you will be prompted for a log
message.</li>
<li>You need to resolve conflicts before CVS will let you commit.</li>
</ul>
You will be left with an up-to-date tree after committing (ie., no
need for separate update).
</p>
<h3>Adding and removing files and directories</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>To add (place under CVS control) a file:
<blockquote><tt>% cvs add file</tt></blockquote></li>
<li>To remove a file (from the current branch):
<blockquote><tt>% cvs remove file</tt></blockquote></li>
</ul>
Neither of these operations takes effect until the changes are
committed.
</p><p>
To rename a file, just <tt>cvs remove</tt> the old name and <tt>cvs
add</tt> the new one.
</p><p>
To add (place under CVS control) a new directory, use <tt>cvs add</tt>
as with a file, but note that the change will take immediate effect
(you will see a "CVS" directory in your working copy of the new
directory, and the repository will have a new, empty, directory in it
also).
</p><p>
Removing a directory is not really supported by CVS. See the docs for
more complete discussion. The <q>solution</q> is to <tt>cvs
remove</tt> all the files in the diectory, and assume that people use
the <tt>-P</tt> option to <tt>cvs checkout</tt> to avoid seeing empty
directories.
</p>
<h3>Using tags</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>A tag is a symbolic name which is associated with a particular version
of a file. Tags usually identify particular points or snapshots in the
development cycle, such as <q>stable-1</q> for example.</li>
<li>You can use a tag name wherever a revision number is allowed, for
example to checkout a specific version of a file. With the tag, you
don't need to remember the specific version number.</li>
<li>Different files can have different version numbers associated with
a given tag. That is, when you tag a collection of files with a given
name, that name refers to the appropriate version for each file. Or
put yet another way, the tag is not a shorthand for a specific version
number. Rather, it's a way of marking all the tagged files at some
specific revision, without having to remember which version number
that was for each of them. The manual actually does a good job of
explaining this.</li>
<li>To tag the current directory and any subdirectories:
<blockquote><tt>% cvs tag <em>name</em></tt></blockquote>
To tag only specific files or directories, pass them as arguments
following the tagname.</li>
<li><b>Note:</b> The one somewhat unintuitive thing about the <tt>cvs
tag</tt> command is that it operates immediately on the repository
versions of the files in the working directory. That is, suppose you
have checked out version 1.3 of some file. Then you modify it. Now if
you tag the file, it will tag version 1.3. If you mean to tag the
version you are working on, you need to commit the changes first, then
tag the new revision. Use the <tt>-c</tt> flag if you want to avoid
this.</li>
<li>To list any tags defined for a file (or files), use the
<tt>-v</tt> flag to <tt>cvs status</tt>:
<blockquote><tt>% cvs status -v <em>file</em></tt></blockquote></li>
</ul>
</p>
<h3>Using branches</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>Branches allow multiple versions of a file (or files) to to be
simultaneously in development. Changes made in one branch do not
affect other branches until they are merged.</li>
<li>To create a branch, you need to tag the appropriate files with the
branch name, passing the <tt>-b</tt> flag to <tt>cvs tag</tt>:
<blockquote><tt>% cvs tag -b <em>branchname</em> ...</tt></blockquote>
Don't forget that this tags the repository revision corresponding to
your working copy, not whatever you are working on.</li>
<li>To put your working copy <q>on the branch</q>, specify the
branch tag name with the <tt>-r</tt> argument to either <tt>cvs
checkout</tt> (for a new working copy) or <tt>cvs update</tt> (for an
existing working directory):
<blockquote><tt>
% cvs checkout -r <em>branchname</em> ...<br/>
</tt></blockquote>
or
<blockquote><tt>
% cvs update -r <em>branchname</em> ...
</tt></blockquote>
Now changes committed to those files will only be seen by other
developers who have checked out the branch, but will not affect other
branches including the main trunk.</li>
<li>Once a working copy is on a branch, <tt>cvs status -v</tt> will
list it as having a <q>sticky tag.</q></li>
<li>When you want to make changes on a branch available to the main
trunk developers, you need to <q>merge</q> the branch. This
assumes that any desired changes have first been committed on the
branch. You then checkout a fresh copy of the trunk into a new working
directory: 
<blockquote><tt>% cvs checkout ...</tt></blockquote>
And then use the <tt>-j</tt> (for join) flag to <tt>cvs update</tt> to
merge changes from a given branch (identified by the name of the
branch tag) into the freshly-checked-out trunk copy:
<blockquote><tt>% cvs update -j <em>branchname</em> ...</tt></blockquote>
CVS will identify any conflicts resulting from the merge (i.e., where
a change on the trunk overlaps with a change on the branch). You will
need to resolve conflicts before committing the changes on the trunk:
<blockquote><tt>% cvs commit -m 'Merged <em>branchname</em>' ...</tt></blockquote></li>
<li>After a merge, the branch continues to exist and can support
ongoing development independently of other branches (and the trunk).
If you want to merge again, to incorporate further changes from the
branch into the trunk, you need to use the <tt>-j</tt> flag twice in
the <tt>cvs update</tt> command. The manual has some suggestions on
how to use tags to make this easier (and see the next section of this
document).</li>
</ul>
</p>
<hr/>
<h2><a name="releases">Managing Releases</a></h2>
<p>
The following notes describe our approach to managing separate
versions of the TRIPS system for different projects or for different
customers of one project. The basic approach is as follows:
<ul>
  <li>Each <q>release</q> of the system is maintained on a separate
    cvs branch</li>
  <li>Each release branch has a designated maintainer</li>
  <li>Either:
    <ul>
      <li>The maintainer is responsible for merging changes from the
	trunk to the release branch; or</li>
      <li>Everybody merges changes from the trunk to the release
	branch, but the maintainer is responsible for testing and
	creating a release from the release branch.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Either way, the majority of development can proceed on the
  trunk. To the extent that TRIPS is one system with different
  configurations and settings, the trunk really should
  represent <q>the system</q> as long as this illusion can be
  maintained</li>
</ul>
Managing release branches properly in cvs requires some planning, as
well as conscientious use of structured tags to keep everything straight.
</p>
<p>
To start a release branch, use the basic steps outlined above to
create a new branch tag. For example, for the <q>plow</q> system, you
might use:
<blockquote><pre>
mkdir plow
cd plow
cvs -d trips:/p/cvs/trips co -P plow
cd src
cvs tag -b plow-sri
</pre></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
To handle merges, you should maintain both a trunk checkout and a
branch checkout, so do the latter now:
<blockquote><pre>
cd ../../
mkdir plow-sri
cd plow-sri
cvs -d trips:/p/cvs/trips co -P -r plow-sri plow
cd src
</pre></blockquote>
</p>
<p>
Whichever maintainer model we're using, either the maintainer or any
developer must periodically merge changes from the trunk to the
release branch. To do this right, you need to operate
on <emph>both</emph> the trunk and the release branch.
<ul>
<li>To merge from trunk to release branch the first time:
  <ul>
    <li>On the trunk:
      <blockquote><pre>
	  cvs tag plow-sri-1
      </pre></blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>On release branch:
      <blockquote><pre>
	  cvs update -j plow-sri-1
      </pre></blockquote>
      Resolve any conflicts, then commit on release branch:
      <blockquote><pre>
          cvs commit -m 'merged plow-sri-1'
      </pre></blockquote>
      Finally, tag the merged revisions (on the release branch) for
      future reference:
      <blockquote><pre>
          cvs tag plow-sri-1-merged
      </pre></blockquote>
      </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>To merge from trunk to release branch subsequent times:
  <ul>
    <li>On the trunk:
      <blockquote><pre>
	  cvs tag plow-sri-2
      </pre></blockquote>
    </li>
    <li>On release branch:
      <blockquote><pre>
	  cvs update -j plow-sri-1 -j plow-sri-2
      </pre></blockquote>
      Resolve any conflicts, then commit on release branch:
      <blockquote><pre>
          cvs commit -m 'merged plow-sri-2'
      </pre></blockquote>
      Finally, tag the merged revisions on the release branch for
      future reference:
      <blockquote><pre>
          cvs tag plow-sri-2-merged
      </pre></blockquote>
      </li>
  </ul>
</li>
<li>As always, use <tt>cvs status -v <emph>file</emph></tt> to check
  tags.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
When the maintainer prepares a release from the release branch, they
should tag the current working copy of the release branch (with a
regular, non-branch tag). For example:
<blockquote><pre>
cvs tag plow-sri-2-release
</pre></blockquote>
This way they can always recreate a released version using the tag.
