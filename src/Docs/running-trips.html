<h1>Running TRIPS</h1>

Basic instructions for running TRIPS:
<ul>
<li>
   Run "<tt>TRIPS_BASE/bin/trips</tt>", where <tt>TRIPS_BASE</tt> is
   the directory containing the "<tt>src</tt>", "<tt>bin</tt>", and
   "<tt>etc</tt>" directories (unless you specified 
   a different installation prefix during configuration).
</li>
<li>Note that specific
   distributions of trips may have specialized run scripts (e.g.,
   <tt>TRIPS_BASE/bin/trips-plow</tt> for the PLOW system).  Check the
   <tt>TRIPS_BASE/bin</tt> directory.
</li>
<li>
   If you have moved the installed system from the configured
   location, you must specify the new prefix by setting
   the <tt>TRIPS_BASE</tt> environment variable prior to launching the
   system.
<li>
   A log directory will be created in whatever directory you ran trips
   from (or you can specify where by setting the environment
   variable <tt>TRIPS_LOGS</tt> prior to running the system). Many
   people create a tmp or log directory somewhere and then create a
   symlink from that directory to the command to run TRIPS.
</li>
</ul>
Developers may also be interested
   in <a href="trips-devel.html">trips-devel.html</a> for
   alternate ways of running TRIPS during development.
