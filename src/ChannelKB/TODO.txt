- have to fire listeners whenever anything changes, like
  channel-status, not just when location-of changes

- have to decide whether to register listeners to this module, or
  just use the existing selective broadcast method

- currently system utts produce channel events with :channel NIL
  this is because the test code and the speechin/speechout stuff
  isn't really up to speed on channels...
