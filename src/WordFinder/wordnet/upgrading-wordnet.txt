Things to change when upgrading WordNet:

config/WordFinder/configure.ac: ac_wordnet_search_list
config/WordFinder/defs.lisp: *wordnet-basepath*
  Change these paths to the new path to the wordnet dict. Delete the configure
  script in this directory so that it will be rebuilt.

WordFinder/wordnet/wordnet-to-trips.lisp: hierarchy-mapping
  These 8-digit numbers are synset offsets, and change with Wordnet version.
  This hash needs to be recalculated, or the offsets need to be adjusted using
  the WNsensemap package. Offset adjustment for this structure can be
  accomplished with the script
  update-hierarchy-mapping-offsets.pl

ParserTools/LexiconTool/GUI/WordnetAnalyzer.java: DictPath
  Again, change the path to the new path to the wordnet dict.
  
make clean
./configure-trips --enable-wordfinder ...
make
make install
