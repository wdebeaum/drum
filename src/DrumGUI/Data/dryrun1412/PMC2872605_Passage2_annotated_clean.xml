<p>In this study, we show that inhibition of <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> by chemical or genetic means in the presence of oncogenic or growth-factor activated <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAS</PROTEIN_FAMILY> induces <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> binding to <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN>, leading to <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> hyperactivation and consequently elevated <PROTEIN_FAMILY>MEK</PROTEIN_FAMILY> and <PROTEIN_FAMILY>ERK</PROTEIN_FAMILY> signaling.
The mechanism we describe is another paradigm of <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAF</PROTEIN_FAMILY> activation downstream of <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAS</PROTEIN_FAMILY> and based on our findings, we propose the following mechanism by which this occurs.
We posit that in <CELL_LINE>RAS mutant cells</CELL_LINE>, <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> maintains <GENE_PROTEIN normalization="BRAF">itself</GENE_PROTEIN> in an inactive conformation through <GENE_PROTEIN normalization="BRAF">its</GENE_PROTEIN> own kinase activity, either through auto-phosphorylation, or by phosphorylating a partner protein that then keeps <GENE_PROTEIN normalization="BRAF">it</GENE_PROTEIN> inactive.
We are currently using mass-spectrometry and mutagenic approaches to elucidate the underlying mechanism.
We propose that when <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> is inhibited, <GENE_PROTEIN normalization="BRAF">it</GENE_PROTEIN> escapes this auto-inhibited state and is recruited to the <SUBCELLULAR_LOCATION>plasma membrane</SUBCELLULAR_LOCATION> by <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAS</PROTEIN_FAMILY>, where <GENE_PROTEIN normalization="BRAF">it</GENE_PROTEIN> forms a stable complex with <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN>.
Critically, we posit that because <GENE_PROTEIN normalization="BRAF">it</GENE_PROTEIN> is inhibited, <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> does not directly phosphorylate <PROTEIN_FAMILY>MEK</PROTEIN_FAMILY>, but rather <GENE_PROTEIN normalization="BRAF">it</GENE_PROTEIN> acts asÂ a scaffold whose function is to enhance <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> activation, thereby allowing <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> to hyperactivate the pathway.
We do not know the stoichiometry of the components in <COMPLEX normalization="BRAF/CRF/RAS">these complexes</COMPLEX>, but since <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> and <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> must both bind to <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAS</PROTEIN_FAMILY> for complex formation, it seems likely that at least two <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAS</PROTEIN_FAMILY> proteins are needed to stimulate formation of <COMPLEX normalization="BRAF/CRF/RAS">the complex</COMPLEX>.</p>
