In contrast to the BRAF-selective inhibitors, the pan-RAF inhibitors appear to induce paradoxical activation of CRAF. They induce BRAF binding to CRAF and CRAF activation, but do not activate MEK–ERK signaling. We posit that this is because these agents target both BRAF and CRAF. Thus, although their inhibition of BRAF will stimulate CRAF activation, they will simultaneously inhibit CRAF (Figure 7C). This model is supported by our observation that T421NCRAF converts sorafenib from a pathway inhibitor to a pathway activator and we argue that the paradoxical activation of CRAF by these inhibitors is mediated by BRAF, rather than disrupted feedback inhibition as previously suggested (Hall-Jackson et al., 1999).
