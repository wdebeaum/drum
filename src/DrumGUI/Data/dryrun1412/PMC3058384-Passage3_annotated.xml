<p id="P4">Oncogenic mutations in the serine/threonine kinase <GENE_PROTEIN>B-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> are found in 50–70% of malignant melanomas<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>. Pre-clinical studies have demonstrated that the <GENE_PROTEIN>B-RAF<sup>V600E</sup></GENE_PROTEIN> mutation predicts a dependency on the <PATHWAY normalization="mitogen activated protein kinase signaling cascade">mitogen activated protein kinase (<PROTEIN_FAMILY>MAPK</PROTEIN_FAMILY>) signaling cascade</PATHWAY> in melanoma<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R1">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R5">5</xref>—an observation that has been validated by the success of <DRUG_CLASS normalization="RAF inhibitors">RAF and <DRUG_CLASS normalization="MEK inhibitors">MEK inhibitors</DRUG_CLASS></DRUG_CLASS> in clinical trials<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R6">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R8">8</xref>. However, clinical responses to <DRUG_CLASS>targeted anticancer therapeutics</DRUG_CLASS> are frequently confounded by <italic>de novo</italic> or acquired resistance<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R9">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R11">11</xref>. Identification of resistance mechanisms in a manner that elucidates alternative ‘druggable’ targets may inform effective long-term treatment strategies<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R12">12</xref>. Here, we expressed ~600 kinase and kinase-related open reading frames (ORFs) in parallel to functionally interrogate resistance to a selective <DRUG_CLASS>RAF kinase inhibitor</DRUG_CLASS>. We identified <italic><GENE_PROTEIN>MAP3K8</GENE_PROTEIN></italic> (<GENE_PROTEIN>COT</GENE_PROTEIN>/<GENE_PROTEIN>TPL2</GENE_PROTEIN>) as a <PATHWAY>MAPK pathway</PATHWAY> agonist that drives resistance to <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAF</PROTEIN_FAMILY> inhibition in <CELL_LINE>B-RAF<sup>V600E</sup> cell lines</CELL_LINE>. <GENE_PROTEIN>COT</GENE_PROTEIN> activates <PROTEIN_FAMILY>ERK</PROTEIN_FAMILY> primarily through <PROTEIN_FAMILY>MEK</PROTEIN_FAMILY>-dependent mechanisms that do not require <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAF</PROTEIN_FAMILY> signaling. Moreover, <GENE_PROTEIN>COT</GENE_PROTEIN> expression is associated with <italic>de novo</italic> resistance in <CELL_LINE>B-RAF<sup>V600E</sup> cultured cell lines</CELL_LINE> and acquired resistance in <CELL_LINE>melanoma cells</CELL_LINE> and tissue obtained from relapsing patients following treatment with <PROTEIN_FAMILY>MEK</PROTEIN_FAMILY> or <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAF</PROTEIN_FAMILY> inhibition. We further identify combinatorial <PATHWAY>MAPK pathway</PATHWAY> inhibition or targeting of <GENE_PROTEIN>COT</GENE_PROTEIN> kinase activity as possible therapeutic strategies for reducing <PATHWAY>MAPK pathway</PATHWAY> activation in this setting. Together, these results provide new insights into resistance mechanisms involving the <PATHWAY>MAPK pathway</PATHWAY> and articulate an integrative approach through which high-throughput functional screens may inform the development of novel therapeutic strategies.</p>
