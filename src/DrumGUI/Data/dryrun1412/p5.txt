We then considered whether COT-expressing cancer cells remain sensitive to MAPK pathway inhibition at a target downstream of COT or RAF. Here, we queried the OUMS-23 and RPMI-7951 cell lines for sensitivity to the MEK1/2 inhibitor CI-1040. Interestingly, both cell lines were refractory to MEK inhibition (Fig. 4a) and displayed sustained ERK phosphorylation even at 1 µM CI-1040 (Fig. 4b). Ectopic COT expression in A375 and SKMEL28 cells also conferred decreased sensitivity to the MEK inhibitors CI-1040 and AZD6244, suggesting that COT expression alone was sufficient to induce this phenotype (Fig. 4c, 4d, Supplementary Fig. 17). Similar to results observed with pharmacological MEK inhibitors, MEK1/2 knockdown only modestly suppressed COT–mediated ERK phosphorylation in A375 cells (Supplementary Fig. 18). In accordance with prior observations24, these data raised the possibility that COT may activate ERK through MEK-independent and MEK-dependent mechanisms. To test this hypothesis directly, we performed an in vitro kinase assay using recombinant COT and ERK1. Indeed, recombinant COT induced pThr202/Tyr204 phosphorylation of ERK1 in vitro (Supplementary Fig. 18) suggesting that in certain contexts, COT expression may potentiate ERK activation in a MEK-independent manner.
