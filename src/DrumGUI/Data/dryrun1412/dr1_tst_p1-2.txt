It was established recently that monoubiquitination increases the proportion of Ras that is in the activated (GTP-bound) state, that monoubiquitination enhances association with the downstream effectors Raf and PI3-Kinase, and that mutation of the primary site of monoubiquitination impairs oncogenic Ras-mediated tumorigenesis.
Here we show that monoubiquitination decreases the sensitivity of Ras to GAP-mediated hydrolysis.
A major advance was our ability to easily generate mUbRas, modified at a single site, in a form suitable for detailed biophysical studies.
This chemical ligation strategy will likely be useful for the study of other monoubiquitinated proteins.
Surprisingly, monoubiquitination did not alter the intrinsic activity of Ras, despite the size of the modification.
Our modeling and NMR analyses indicated that Ubiquitin dynamically samples a broad surface area of Ras that alters switch region dynamics.
These results led us to examine the effect of monoubiquitination on the interaction of Ras with its cognate GEF and GAPs, which also target the switch domains.
The analysis revealed that monoubiquitination abrogates GAP-mediated GTP hydrolysis.
All other activities, including the ability to bind regulators, were largely preserved and our kinetic modeling suggests that the GAP defect will dominate.
Furthermore, this outcome was specific to monoubiquitination at position 147.
Thus our work establishes an entirely new mode of Ras activation in which signaling is sustained even in the absence of hormone stimulus or oncogene mutation.
