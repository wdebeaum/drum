We selected four drugs for our studies (Figures S1A–S1D). Sorafenib is a class II (inactive conformation binder) drug (Wan et al., 2004) that inhibits V600EBRAF at 40 nM, CRAF at 13 nM, and several other kinases in the low nM range (Wilhelm et al., 2004). It is the least-selective drug that we used. PLX4720 is a class I (active conformation binder) inhibitor that is highly selective and inhibits V600EBRAF at 13 nM (Tsai et al., 2008). 885-A (Figure S1C) is a close analog of the class I inhibitor SB590885 (King et al., 2006) that is also highly selective for BRAF. It inhibits V600EBRAF at 2 nM (Figure S1E), is ineffective against a panel of 64 other protein kinases (Table S1), and preferentially blocks BRAF mutant cancer cell proliferation (Figure S1F). Finally, we also used the potent and selective MEK inhibitor PD184352 (Sebolt-Leopold et al., 1999).
As expected, all four drugs blocked ERK activity in BRAF mutant A375 melanoma cells (Figure 1A; see Table S2). Similarly, all four drugs inhibited ERK in SkMel24, SkMel28, D25, and WM266.4 cells, another four lines that express mutant BRAF (Figure S1G). We also tested the drugs in D04, MM415, MM485, and WM852 NRAS mutant cells (Table S2). As expected, PD184352 and sorafenib inhibited ERK in all of these lines (Figure 1A). Surprisingly, however, PLX4720 and 885-A caused an unexpected increase in ERK activity in the NRAS mutant cells (Figure 1A). NRAS or CRAF depletion by RNA interference (RNAi) blocked MEK/ERK activation by PLX4720 and 885-A in NRAS mutant cells (Figure 1B and 1C) and we show that 885-A activated CRAF in these cells (Figure 1D). We previously reported that oncogenic RAS requires CRAF but not BRAF to activate MEK (Dumaz et al., 2006) and consistent with this, BRAF is inactive in NRAS mutant cells (Figure 1E). These data therefore present an intriguing paradox. BRAF is not active and is not required for MEK/ERK activation in RAS mutant cells. Nevertheless, BRAF inhibitors hyperactivate CRAF and MEK in these cells, so we studied the underlying mechanism(s).
