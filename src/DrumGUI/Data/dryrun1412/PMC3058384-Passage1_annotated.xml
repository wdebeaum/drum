 <p id="P6">Next, we tested whether overexpression of these genes was sufficient to activate the <PATHWAY>MAPK pathway.</PATHWAY> At baseline, <GENE_PROTEIN>COT</GENE_PROTEIN> expression increased <PROTEIN_FAMILY>ERK</PROTEIN_FAMILY> phosphorylation in a manner comparable to <GENE_PROTEIN>MEK1<sup>DD</sup></GENE_PROTEIN>, consistent with <PATHWAY>MAP kinase pathway</PATHWAY> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 6</xref>). Overexpression of wild-type <GENE_PROTEIN>COT</GENE_PROTEIN> or <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> resulted in constitutive phosphorylation of <PROTEIN_FAMILY>ERK</PROTEIN_FAMILY> and <PROTEIN_FAMILY>MEK</PROTEIN_FAMILY> in the presence of <DRUG>PLX4720</DRUG>, whereas kinase-dead derivatives had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 7</xref>). Based on these results, we hypothesized that <GENE_PROTEIN>COT</GENE_PROTEIN> and <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> drive resistance to <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAF</PROTEIN_FAMILY> inhibition predominantly through re-activation of <PATHWAY>MAPK</PATHWAY> signaling. Notably, of the nine candidate ORFs from our initial screen, a subset (3) did not show persistent <PATHWAY><PROTEIN_FAMILY>ERK</PROTEIN_FAMILY><PROTEIN_FAMILY>/MEK</PROTEIN_FAMILY></PATHWAY> phosphorylation following <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAF</PROTEIN_FAMILY> inhibition, suggesting <PATHWAY>MAPK pathway</PATHWAY>-independent alteration of drug sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 8</xref>).</p>
    <p id="P7">Several groups have shown that <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> activation and heterodimerization with <GENE_PROTEIN>B-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> constitute critical components of the cellular response to <GENE_PROTEIN>B-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> inhibition<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R15">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R18">18</xref>. In <CELL_LINE>A375</CELL_LINE> cells, endogenous <COMPLEX>C-RAF: B-RAF</COMPLEX> heterodimers were measurable and inducible following treatment with <DRUG>PLX4720</DRUG> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). However, endogenous <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> phosphorylation at S338—an event required for <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> activation—remained low (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). In contrast, ectopically expressed <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> was phosphorylated on S338 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>) and <GENE_PROTEIN normalization="ectopically expressed C-RAF">its</GENE_PROTEIN> <DRUG>PLX4720</DRUG> resistance phenotype was associated with sustained <PATHWAY><PROTEIN_FAMILY>MEK</PROTEIN_FAMILY>/<PROTEIN_FAMILY>ERK</PROTEIN_FAMILY></PATHWAY> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 9</xref>). Moreover, ectopic expression of a high-activity <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> truncation mutant (<GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN>(W22) was more effective than wild-type <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> in mediating <DRUG>PLX4720</DRUG> resistance and <PROTEIN_FAMILY>ERK</PROTEIN_FAMILY> activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1">Supplementary Fig. 10</xref>), further indicating that elevated <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> activity may direct resistance to <DRUG normalization="PLX4720">this agent</DRUG>. Consistent with this model, oncogenic alleles of <italic><GENE_PROTEIN>NRAS</GENE_PROTEIN></italic> and <italic><GENE_PROTEIN>KRAS</GENE_PROTEIN></italic> conferred <DRUG>PLX4720</DRUG> resistance in <CELL_LINE>A375</CELL_LINE> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2b</xref>) and yielded sustained <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN>(S338) and <PROTEIN_FAMILY>ERK</PROTEIN_FAMILY> phosphorylation in the context of drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="F2">Fig. 2c</xref>). Thus, although genetic alterations that engender <GENE_PROTEIN>C-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> activation (e.g., oncogenic <PROTEIN_FAMILY>RAS</PROTEIN_FAMILY> mutations) tend to show mutual exclusivity with <GENE_PROTEIN>B-RAF<sup>V600E</sup></GENE_PROTEIN> mutation, such co-occurring events<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R19">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="R20">20</xref> might be favored in the context of acquired resistance to <GENE_PROTEIN>B-RAF</GENE_PROTEIN> inhibition.</p>
