A synthetic peptide encoding amino acids 824-832, with a phosphoserine at residue 827, was used to raise antibodies. 
A polyclonal antibody NGH.S4 was purified by affinity column purification. 
To test the efficacy of the purified phospho-specific antibody, a non-radioactive in vitro phosphorylation assay was performed on the purified GST-ASPP2 fragment (693-1128) with recombinant MAPK1. 
<xref>Figure 1C</xref> shows that the phosphospecific antibody is specific for the ASPP2 fragment phosphorylated in vitro by MAPK.
To test whether endogenous ASPP2 could be phosphorylated in cells, Saos2 cells were grown in low serum for 50 hours to remove all background stimulation of RAS, after which the cells were stimulated with EGF and 20% fetal calf serum (FCS). 
Phosphorylated endogenous ASPP2 was detected by the phospho-specific antibody 30 minutes after RAS stimulation (<xref>Figure 1D</xref>). 
ASPP2 phosphorylation was rapid and transient as 3 hours after EGF stimulation phosphorylated ASPP2 was barely detectable. 
Moreover, with another different phospho-ASPP2 antibody, ES1, ASPP2 phosphorylation was also observed in a human colon cancer cell line HKe3 ER:HRASV12 cells, in which RAS activation is induced upon the addition of 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OHT) [<xref>2</xref>,<xref>10</xref>,<xref>11</xref>] (<xref>Figure 1E</xref>). 
The phospho-specific antibody for ASPP2 is specific as knockdown of ASPP2 resulted in a lack of detection of phospho-ASPP2. 
All these demonstrate that ASPP2 is a novel substrate of MAPK and Ser827 of ASPP2 can be phosphorylated by RAS/MAPK pathway.
