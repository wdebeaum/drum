<p>In contrast to the <DRUG_CLASS>BRAF-selective inhibitors</DRUG_CLASS>, the <DRUG_CLASS>pan-RAF inhibitors</DRUG_CLASS> appear to induce paradoxical activation of <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN>. <DRUG_CLASS normalization="pan-RAF inhibitors">They</DRUG_CLASS> induce <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> binding to <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> and <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> activation, but do not activate <PATHWAY>MEK–ERK</PATHWAY> signaling. We posit that this is because <DRUG_CLASS normalization="pan-RAF inhibitors">these agents</DRUG_CLASS> target both <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> and <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN>. Thus, although <DRUG_CLASS normalization="pan-RAF inhibitors">their</DRUG_CLASS> inhibition of <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> will stimulate <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> activation, <DRUG_CLASS normalization="pan-RAF inhibitors">they</DRUG_CLASS> will simultaneously inhibit <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>C). This model is supported by our observation that <GENE_PROTEIN><sup>T421N</sup>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> converts <DRUG>sorafenib</DRUG> from a <PATHWAY normalization="MEK-ERK">pathway</PATHWAY> inhibitor to a <PATHWAY normalization="MEK-ERK">pathway</PATHWAY> activator and we argue that the paradoxical activation of <GENE_PROTEIN>CRAF</GENE_PROTEIN> by <DRUG_CLASS normalization="pan-RAF inhibitors">these inhibitors</DRUG_CLASS> is mediated by <GENE_PROTEIN>BRAF</GENE_PROTEIN>, rather than disrupted feedback inhibition as previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hall-Jackson et al., 1999</xref>).</p>
