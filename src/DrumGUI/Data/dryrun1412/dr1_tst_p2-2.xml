We and others have recently shown that ASPP2 can potentiate RAS signaling by binding directly via the ASPP2 N-terminus [<xref>2</xref>,<xref>6</xref>].
Moreover, the RAS-ASPP interaction enhances the transcription function of p53 in cancer cells [<xref>2</xref>].
Until now, it has been unclear how RAS could affect ASPP2 to enhance p53 function.
We show here that ASPP2 is phosphorylated by the RAS/Raf/MAPK pathway and that this phosphorylation leads to its increased translocation to the cytosol/nucleus and increased binding to p53, providing an explanation of how RAS can activate p53 pro-apoptotic functions (<xref>Figure 5</xref>).
Additionally, RAS/Raf/MAPK pathway activation stabilizes ASPP2 protein, although the underlying mechanism remains to be investigated.
