The most frequently mutated oncogenes in the deadliest cancers responsible for human mortality are KRAS, PIK3CA and BRAF. Importantly the signaling enzymes encoded by PIK3CA and BRAF are, in part, regulated by direct binding to activated forms of the Ras proteins suggesting that dysregulation of this key step in signaling is critical for tumor formation. Ras acts as a molecular switch that is activated upon GTP loading and deactivated upon hydrolysis of GTP to GDP. This switch mechanism is common to a wide variety of GTP-binding proteins and is mediated by a conserved structure called the G-domain that consists of five conserved G boxes. Under physiological conditions, the rate of GDP or GTP release from the G-domain is slow. As a consequence the GDP produced by GTP hydrolysis on Ras is trapped and the bulk of cellular Ras accumulates in the GDP-bound 'off' state, despite the high GTP/GDP ratio in the cytosol (1-3). Growth factors can turn on Ras by activating Guanine nucleotide Exchange Factors (GEFs) or by inhibiting the GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs) or by both mechanisms. RasGEFs bind to Ras and lower the transition energy for the nucleotide exchange of the bound GDP for the more abundant cytosolic GTP, whereas RasGAPs bind to Ras and catalyze GTP hydrolysis. The most prevalent oncogenic mutations in Ras (Gly12 and Gly13 in the G1 box, and Gln61 in the G3 box) preserve the GTP bound state by inhibiting intrinsic GTPase activity and by interfering with the ability of GAPs. Other less frequently observed mutations, such as those found in the G4 and G5 boxes, increase the rate of nucleotide exchange, thereby mimicking the GEFs and increasing the GTP-bound state (1-7).
