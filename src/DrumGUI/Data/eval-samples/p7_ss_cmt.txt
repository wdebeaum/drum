To determine if this feedback model explains the activation of PI3K signaling in EGFR-mutant cancers, we used shRNA to knockdown endogenous EGFR (which carries an exon 19 deletion) in the cell line and replaced with either EGFR  wild-type at T669, or EGFR carrying a T669A mutation. Of note, this is the same EGFR-mutant cell line in which we observed that EGFR T669 is phosphorylated in MEK-dependent manner (Figure 5, Supplemental Figure 8A). When endogenous EGFR was replaced with EGFR (exon19del) wild-type at T669, MEK inhibition led to significant feedback activation of MAPK cascade signaling (Figure 6C). However, replacement with the EGFR T669A mutant led to increased tyrosine phosphorylation of both EGFR and ERBB3, and activation of MAPK cascade signaling, mimicking the effect of MEK inhibition (Figure 6C). As expected, addition of AZD6244 failed to further augment ERBB3 and AKT phosphorylation in cells expressing the 669A mutant. These results demonstrate that EGFR T669 phosphorylation is necessary for MAPK cascade to suppress EGFR-mediated activation of ERBB3. This supports the hypothesis that a dominant ERK feedback on MAPK cascade is mediated through phosphorylation of T669 on EGFR (or T677 HER2).
