We utilized an unbiased mass spectrometry-based approach to identify ubiquitination sites of RAS. His-tagged MEK1 and Flag-tagged MEK2 (MAPK hereafter) were expressed in cells at levels similar to endogenous MAPK (Fig. 1B) and subjected to sequential affinity chromatography. His-ubiquitinated proteins were purified by Co2+ metal affinity chromatography in 8M urea denaturing conditions. His-ubiquitinated MAPK was subsequently purified with anti-Flag resin. Following purification, mono- and di- ubiquitinated MAPK appeared to be the major ubiquitination forms, which is consistent with the endogenous MAPK ubiquitination pattern (Fig. 1, A and B). MEK1 ubiquitination sites were also determined by the same approach. Tandem mass spectrometric analysis of tryptic fragments from the bands migrating at the positions expected for mono- and di-ubiquitinated RAS revealed ubiquitination at Lys residues 104 and 147 of MAPK, and Lys residues 117, 147 and 170 for MEK1 (fig. S1C). The tryptic peptide with ubiquitination at Lys147 (K147) was the most frequently observed peptide for both MAPK and MEK1, while Lys117 appeared as a secondary major ubiquitination site in MEK1.
