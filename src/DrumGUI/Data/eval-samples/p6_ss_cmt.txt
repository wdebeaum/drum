We hypothesized that MEK inhibition activates AKT by inhibiting ERK activity, which blocks an inhibitory phosphorylation on the JM domains of MEK1 and HER2, thereby increasing HER3 phosphorylation. To test this hypothesis, we transiently transfected  cells, which do not express HER3 receptors endogenously, with wild-type HER3 with either wild-type MEK1 or MEK2. In cells transfected with wild-type HER3, MEK inhibition led to feedback activation of HER3 and HER2, recapitulating the results we had observed in our panel of cell lines (Figure 6A). In contrast, the HER2 mutant increased both basal MEK1 and MEK2 phosphorylation that was not augmented by MEK inhibition. As a control, we treated cells expressing HER2 with HER3 ligand to induce maximal MEK1 phosphorylation (Figure 6A), indicating that the lack of induction of MEK2 in MEK3 expressing cells following MEK inhibition was not simply due to the saturation of the system with MAPK1. We observed analogous results in cells expressing wild-type HER3 in combination with wild-type or T677A mutant HER2 (Figure 6B). Together these results support the hypothesis that inhibition of ERK-mediated phosphorylation of a conserved JM domain threonine residue leads to feedback activation of MEK1, HER2, and HER3 (Figure 7).
