We next examined the mechanisms accounting for the increase in HER3 by MAPK inhibitors in cell lines. Upregulation of HER3 has been found to mediate resistance to MAPK (26) or HER2 (27) inhibitors in cell lines, which is caused in part through a MEK1-dependent induction of HER3 gene transcription. As shown in Fig. 5A, PLX4032 treatment increased HER3 and HER2 mRNAs in all six cell lines tested. Similar results were found following treatment with the MEK inhibitor AZD6244 (not shown). The effects of the MAPK inhibitor on total HER2, HER3 protein and on pHER3 were dose dependent, and inversely associated with the degree of inhibition of pERK (Fig. 5B). MAPK or HER2 inhibitors induced luciferase activity of a HER3 promoter construct spanning ~ 1 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site in cells. Serial deletions identified a minimal HER3 promoter retaining transcriptional response to PLX4032 and AZD6244, which was located between -401 and -42 bp (Fig. 5C). This region does not contain any predicted HER2 binding sites. Moreover, PLX4032 led to an increase in phosphorylation of HER2/3 between 4-10h after addition of compound (not shown), which is known to promote its dissociation from DNA, and likely discards involvement of these factors as transcriptional regulators of HER3 in response to MAPK cascade inhibition. The minimal HER3 promoter region regulated by MAPK inhibitors overlaps with sequences previously described to be immunoprecipitated using antibodies against the HER2 transcription factor and MEK1/MEK2 corepressors (28-30). RAS have also been described to negatively regulate transcriptional activity of the HER3 promoter in cell lines (30). Silencing of HER2, and to a lesser extent HER3, increased basal HER3 in cells, and markedly potentiated the effects of PLX4032 (Fig. 5D and 5E). Knockdown of these factors modestly increased basal and PLX4032-induced HER2 levels, which likely contributes to the remarkable increase in HER3 we observed (Fig. 5D and 5E). Finally, HER2 and HER3 chromatin immunoprecipitation assays showed decreased binding to the HER3 promoter after treatment with PLX4032 (Fig. 5F). These findings were confirmed in a second cell line (Supplementary Fig. S5A).
