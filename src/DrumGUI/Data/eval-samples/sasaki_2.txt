Activated Ras controls diverse signaling pathways that ultimately determine Ras-induced cellular responses such as cell proliferation, survival, differentiation and motility. These multiple Ras functions depend on its binding to a range of functionally diverse effector molecules such as Raf, PI3K, AF6 and RASSFs (1). The enhancement of specific effector pathways plays a critical role in maintaining an appropriate biological response (8). The specificity in Ras-induced signaling is primarily determined by the balance between Ras affinity for each of its effectors and the local concentrations of those effectors. In addition, scaffold proteins have been shown to guide activation of specific effector pathway(s). For example, SHOC2/Sur-8 bridges Ras and Raf to specifically enhance the Raf/MEK/ERK pathway without enhancing PI3K/AKT signaling (9, 10).
